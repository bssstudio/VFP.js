VFP.js - Visual Flow Programming
================================

This is a simple JS tool to enable visual representation of certain things linked together. It features a simple "editor" where you move the boxes around and make connections between them. 

Note: this is only a tool allow users to do things more viusally. It does not provide the semantics of the application. This is up to the application using this library.
